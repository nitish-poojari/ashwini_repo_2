SELECT odate,count(onum)  FROM orders GROUP BY odate ORDER BY count(onum) DESC;

-- 4)Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for whom this total is
greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
SELECT sum(amt) as total FROM orders GROUP BY snum HAVING sum(amt)>(SELECT MAX(amt)FROM orders); 

-- 5)Write a query that selects the highest rating in each city
SELECT MAX(rating) as MAX_rating FROM customers GROUP BY city;

-- 6)Largest order taken by each salesperson with order value more than Rs.3000. 
SELECT MAX(amt) FROM orders GROUP BY snum HAVING MAX(amt) >3000;

-- 7)Select each customer smallest order.
